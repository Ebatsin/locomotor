# Locomotor

Locomotor is a real and fictional vehicles comparator. It is based on predefined criteria that the user can select. It outputs a list of the vehicles that fit the most the user's query. The comparator works in a client/server design, allowing multiple users to use the same dataset at the same time.

The project also offers 2 clients. The first one is an administation interface which allow the user to modify the dataset, the other is an easy to use interface enabling the user to search for a vehicle.
