# Locomotor

Locomotor is a real and fictional vehicles comparator. It is based on predefined criterias that the user can select. It outputs a list of the vehicles that fit "the most" the user's query. The comparator works in a client/server design, allowing multiple users to use the same dataset at the same time.

The project offers 2 clients: 

- the first one is an administation interface which allow the user to modify the dataset.
- the other is an easy to use interface enabling the user to search for a vehicle and retrieve his booking.
